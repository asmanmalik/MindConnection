        <h2>Understanding trauma and post-traumatic stress</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Trauma can refer to experiences that are overwhelming, frightening, or deeply distressing. These
          events can affect how you feel, how your body responds to stress, and how you see yourself and the
          world. Some individuals develop post-traumatic stress symptoms that persist long after the event has
          ended.
        </p>

        <h3>Common experiences may include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Intrusive memories or reminders of what happened</li>
          <li>Feeling “on edge,” easily startled, or constantly alert</li>
          <li>Avoiding places, conversations, or activities that bring up memories</li>
          <li>Changes in sleep, mood, or concentration</li>
          <li>Feeling disconnected from yourself or others</li>
          <li>Difficulty feeling safe, even in everyday situations</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #5f6368;">
          These reactions are understandable responses to very difficult experiences. They are also treatable,
          and you do not have to navigate them alone.

        <h2>Our trauma-informed approach</h2>
        <p class="section-intro">
          Our goal is to provide care that is respectful, structured, and guided by your pace. Trauma-informed
          care means that we are attentive to safety, choice, and the impact of past experiences on how you
          feel in the present.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Safety and stabilization first</h3>
            <p>
              We begin by focusing on helping you feel as safe and grounded as possible, both in sessions and
              in daily life. We discuss what helps you feel more comfortable and what might make sessions feel
              manageable, and we avoid pushing you to share more than you wish.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Collaboration and choice</h3>
            <p>
              You are an active partner in decisions about your care. We explain treatment options in clear
              language and invite questions and feedback. You can let us know what feels manageable, and we
              will adjust the pace together.

            <h3>Evidence-based therapies</h3>
            <p>
              We draw on trauma-focused, evidence-based therapies that have been shown to help with
              post-traumatic stress. We may integrate skills for managing distress, understanding triggers, and
              building a greater sense of control, based on what is appropriate for you.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Holistic support for daily life</h3>
            <p>
              We consider how sleep, stress, relationships, and other aspects of daily life interact with
              trauma responses. We may suggest practical strategies for building routines, setting boundaries,
              and identifying supportive resources.

          to share that with us so we can proceed more carefully.

          We recognize that beginning trauma-focused care can feel uncertain. Our process is designed to be
          structured, transparent, and guided by your readiness.

            <h3>1. Initial consultation and safety planning</h3>
            <p>
              In the first visit, we focus on understanding what you are experiencing now, your goals for
              treatment, and what helps you feel safer. You can share as much or as little detail as you feel
              comfortable. We may also discuss immediate supports or safety strategies if needed.

            <p>
              If we agree that our services are a good fit, we develop a treatment plan together. This may
              include trauma-focused therapy, skills for managing distress, and, when appropriate, coordination
              with psychiatric care. We explain the plan in clear terms and invite your input.

            <h3>3. Ongoing support and adjustment</h3>
            <p>
              As treatment progresses, we regularly review what is helpful and where adjustments might be
              needed. We recognize that trauma work can be challenging, and we aim to move at a pace that feels
              tolerable while still supporting progress toward your goals.

            <h3>Do I have to talk about what happened in detail?</h3>
            <p>
              No. We will not ask you to describe events in detail before you are ready. Early sessions often
              focus on your current symptoms, safety, and coping strategies. Over time, we can discuss how much
              detail feels manageable and proceed at your pace.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>What if I feel worse when I start talking about trauma?</h3>
            <p>
              It is common to have concerns about feeling worse when beginning trauma-focused care. We work to
              establish grounding skills and safety strategies early in treatment and check in regularly about
              how you are feeling. You can let us know at any time if something feels too intense so we can
              adjust the approach.

            <p>
              In some cases, trauma-focused care can be provided through secure online sessions. Together, we
              will consider whether teletherapy is appropriate and how to set up a space that feels as private
              and safe as possible.
